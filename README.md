# TIL

Just starting to write down some things I learned (from easy to complex, no limit in either direction) and maybe even add some snippets. _The first things will probably be things i did not learn today, but forgot how to do right away again._

I stole the idea from someone, I don't have the repo link right know, but I will give him credit. His one is very interesting to read through as well.
